## `11_data_segmentation.sql`
**Objective:** Segment customers or products by relevant criteria.  
**Insights:**  
 
 We group our customers into three segments based on their spending behavior:
- VIP: Customers with at least 12 months of history and spending more than â‚¬5,000.
- 	 Regular: Customers with at least 12 months of history but spending â‚¬5,000 or less.
- New: Customers with a lifespan less than 12 months.

Based on these results we have:

- Regular	: 2037 customers
- New	: 14828 customers
- VIP: 1619 customers
  


On the other hand by segmenting our product by cost range we get this:
- 110 products are "Below 100"
- 101 products are in "100-500" range
- And 45 products in  "500-1000"	range
- finally 39 products are "Above 1000"
